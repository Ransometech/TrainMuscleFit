Based on the top 100 songs from 2018, the average values are:
Energy: 0.66 (high)
Valence: 0.48 (moderate)
Danceability: 0.72 (high)
This means the listener's favorite songs are generally energetic and danceable but have a balanced, slightly cheerful mood.


Why This Might Not Be Very Representative:

Averages Miss Details: Averages don't show the variety of moods in the songs. For example, there could be both very happy and very sad songs.
Changes Over Time: The listener's mood and music preferences might change throughout the year, which isn't shown by a single average.
Equal Weight: All songs are given equal importance, even though some might be more meaningful to the listener.
Better Ways to Calculate the Aura:

Look at the Median: Use the middle value to better understand typical moods.
Group Similar Songs: Cluster songs into mood categories.
Weight by Play Count: Give more importance to songs played more often.
Track Changes Over Time: See how preferences change throughout the year.
