Why This Might Not Be Accurate:

Averages Miss Variety: There could be both happy and sad songs.
Changes Over Time: Music tastes can change during the year.
Equal Weight: Every song is treated the same, but some songs might matter more.
Better Ways to Calculate the Aura:

Use the Median: The middle value might be more accurate.
Group Similar Songs: Put songs into mood categories.
Weight by Play Count: Give more importance to frequently played songs.
Track Changes Over Time: See how tastes change throughout the year.
